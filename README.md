# count-sand-paradox

THIS BOT IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS, and it is not reccomended to add it to your server! Right now, this bot is probably broken, lacking features, or both!

A discord bot for people wanting to test the [Sorites paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox) by reverse counting sand in a heap.

## The paradox

Want to start an argument in your discord server? Here's one:

    1,000,000 grains of sand is a heap of sand.
    A heap of sand minus one grain is still a heap.

Soo...

    1,000,000 grains is a heap.
    If 1,000,000 grains is a heap then 999,999 grains is a heap.
    So 999,999 grains is a heap.
    If 999,999 grains is a heap then 999,998 grains is a heap.
    So 999,998 grains is a heap.
    If ...
    ... So 1 grain is a heap.

But 1 grain isn't a heap! So... how many grains is a heap? Let discord decide!
